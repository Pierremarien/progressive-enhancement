        <h2>The story</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They
            said,
            <q class="villagers"
              >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
              unfortunate.</q
            >
            The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The next day
            the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the
            evening everybody came back and said,
            <q class="villagers"
              >Oh, isn&apos;t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
              have eight horses!</q
            >
            The farmer again said,
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and
            while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then
            said,
            <q class="villagers"
              >Oh dear, that&apos;s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q
            >
            and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q> The
            next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
            into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken
            leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <q class="villagers">Isn&apos;t that great!</q> Again, he said,
            <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote class="last_quote">
          <p>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
            complexity, and it&apos;s really impossible to tell whether anything
            that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or
            <span class="bad">bad</span> â€” because you never know what will be
            the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
            the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are
          just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for
          monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for
          bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
